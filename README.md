Numerical Simulation of Chemical Reaction System

This project presents a numerical simulation of a reversible and competitive reaction system with catalyst deactivation, solved using standard numerical methods.

The concentration profiles of all species and catalyst activity are analyzed and compared across different numerical techniques.
RK4 was identified as the most reliable method, offering the best balance of accuracy and stability for dynamic systems.

Techniques
Euler Method, RK4, Gauss-Seidel, and Gauss Elimination
